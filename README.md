# Airport
License applies only to my code. 

Images and models were taken from the internet and are in no means used for commercial purposes! I don't claim that I made them and images still preserve their original watermark if they had one.

This project was created only for educational purposes whilst I was studying at De Montfort University, 2nd Year.

Please note, this project will not compile. I had to remove all models and a skybox, because of github file size restriction.

Supplied Airport.png file presents a rendered scene.
